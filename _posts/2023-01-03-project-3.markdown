description: "
\"I have a masters degree in technology and I'm currently working remotely to Finland as a software developer. All I need is my laptop, and my back needs a chair and a table to work on. An apartment with a small study room or corner would be ideal, but I manage with just kitchen chair and dinner table just fine. Right now I work in a project as a full stack developer, and my monthly salary is 4200â‚¬. That's roughly 6600A$ before taxes.
<br>
<br>
I am a tinkerer by nature, meaning that I love to craft with electronics and woodworks. This has proven very useful as a house owner, as I'm perfectly capable of repairing defective electronics and fixing broken interior.

Need help with computer issues? Happy to help a friend (or a landlord) in need!
