I'm a skillful veterinarian with 5 years of experience and a passion for cats (but I also like other small animals!) Since starting vet school I have always dreamed of coming to Australia and experience Australia's veterinary medicine first hand. It was a lucky coincidence when I bumped into Dr. Michael Linton during last year's ISFM congress. When he offered me an internship position it didn't take long for me to say 'yes!'. So here we are, working in Sydney Veterinary and Emergency Specialists hospital. Looking forward to this following and super interesting year!
<br>
<br>
My salary during the internship is solid 6000A$ per month. Besides that I also have quite some savings so rent management won't be a problem. 
<br>
<br>
Tidy house is a must for me and functional kitchen is the place to be.
